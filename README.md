# WizardAdventure
This game was made just using SDL2, everything was pretty much hard-coded.
SDL Version used: 32-bit ver.

  -SDL2_image-2.0.5
  
  -SDL2_mixer-2.0.4
  
  -SDL2_ttf-2.0.18
  
  -SDL2-2.0.20

If there's any bugs, it should be due to your installation, or it is just me forgetting to commit changes.
I personally used CodeBlocks to test and run the game.
