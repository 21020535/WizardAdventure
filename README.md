# WizardAdventure
This game was made just using SDL2, everything was pretty much hard-coded.
SDL Version used: 32-bit ver.

  -SDL2_image-2.0.5
  
  -SDL2_mixer-2.0.4
  
  -SDL2_ttf-2.0.18
  
  -SDL2-2.0.20

If there's any bugs, it should be due to your installation, or your computer isn't quite good, or it is just me forgetting to commit changes.
I personally used CodeBlocks to test and run the game.

Control: WASD for movements, Spacebar for ice-attack. When you hit level 3, you will be able to shoot projectiles, the projectiles will be fired towards your cursor position (keep it inside the window pls). As you progress in level, you will be able to fire more projectiles (spread out) at once.

Objectives: Survive as long as you can! The final wave of enemies comes in at 10 minute mark, if the player manage to clear all the enemies, they win!

As of background music, I added some track*.wav files in the "res" folder. If you want to change the music, you can rename the desired track into "track.wav" (watch out because sometimes windows hide the .wav part and if you change the file name into .wav, its actual name would be track.wav.wav)
